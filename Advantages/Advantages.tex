The two level tree structures and multi level tree structures, each has their own advantages and challenges. The two level tree WSNs will have more throughput when compared with multi level tree WSNs. Also, two level WSNs will have less end-to-end delay. Among the two level structures, progressive completes data aggregation with less delay when compared with balanced two level tree WSNs. These properties of progressive WSNs enable them to be used in applications where timely critical warnings are to be given. At the same time, balanced two level WSNs are easy to construct when compared with progressive two level tree WSN.\\[1ex]

Multi level tree WSNs have less jitter when compared with two level tree WSNs. Also, they have less aggregation delay compared to two level trees. But construction of such multi level tree WSNs is complex. Multi level tree WSNs are preferred when area to be monitored is very large.\\[1ex]
